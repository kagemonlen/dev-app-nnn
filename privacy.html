    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: May 1, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a development application created for testing purposes only. It uses Google OAuth to access limited user data in accordance with Google’s policies.</p>
    <p>We do not store, share, or sell any personal information. The data accessed is used solely for the purposes of demonstrating or testing the application.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Access</h2>
    <p>In order to provide the functionality of the application, we may request access to certain data from your Google account via OAuth authentication. The information that we access is limited to the data necessary for testing purposes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>We may request access to your basic profile information, such as your name and email address.</li>
        <li>We do not store this data permanently or share it with third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since this is a development application, all data used is temporary and only exists during the current session. No data is stored on our servers once the session ends.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your data, but since this is a development application, it may not have the same security standards as a fully released production application.</p>

    <h2>5. Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This application uses Google OAuth to authenticate users and access Google services. By using this application, you agree to Google’s privacy policies and terms of service, which can be found here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>This application is provided "as-is." We do not make any representations or warranties regarding the completeness, accuracy, or security of your data.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the application after changes to this Privacy Policy will be deemed acceptance of those changes.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the data we collect, please contact the developer at: <a href="mailto:bogowakkel@gmail.com">[your email]</a></p>
